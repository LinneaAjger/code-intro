      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>The web is made for everyone. Accessibility is about fulfilling this statement. People with impairments and disabilities may interact with the web through tools that enable them to work around their constraints, but an impairment can also be as simple as needing slightly larger text. Building accessible websites makes it possible to include and reach out to as many users as possible and itâ€™s even demanded by the law in some countries.</p>
